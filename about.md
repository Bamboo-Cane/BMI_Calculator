#### What is BMI?

**Body Mass Index (BMI)** is a measurement of a person’s weight with
respect to his or her height. It is more of an indicator than a direct
measurement of a person’s total body fat.

#### Calculating the BMI

BMI can be computed by dividing the person’s weight (kg) by their
squared height (m) as follows:

> BMI = kg/m^2

where *kg* represents the person’s weight and *m^2* the person’s squared
height.
